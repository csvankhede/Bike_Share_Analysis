# bike_share_system

Bike_share_system data analysis and histograms using different city's bike share data.

In this project, exploratory analysis is performed on the data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. Here I have Compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC, to see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

#### Below are some plot of Exploratory data analysis

In abive plot peak of distribution for subscriber is near 9 min and for customer is 20 min.shape of distribution of subscriber is right-skewed(positive skew) and for customers it is normally distributed(Bell-shaped).

In above plot we can see that during the time 17 the system is used the most,subscribers use the the system most than customers all the time.
